            <p className="italic text-gray-300">
              It is believed that the King was once a just ruler — wise, beloved, and resolute. But something changed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              They say it began with a war he never wished to fight. The crown was dragged into bloodshed by betrayal
              from within — his council poisoned, his generals bribed, his heirs slaughtered before his eyes. The King
              won the war, but lost everything that made him human.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              In the ashes of his grief, he found a goblet — no one knows where it came from. Crafted of obsidian and
              bone, it was said to whisper promises only he could hear. It showed him visions: of justice through pain,
              of loyalty through fear.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              He drank.
              <br />
              And with that, the King was no longer a man. He became a judge, a god, a warden of fate. The throne room
              turned into a chamber of trials. And those who defied him — traitors, prisoners, rebels, and even the
              innocent — were offered one chance:
            </p>

            <div className="text-yellow-200 text-center font-semibold text-lg my-4">
              Sit. Choose a chalice. Drink. Survive, and walk free.
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Each goblet was different. Some blessed. Some cursed. The players were given relics — ancient artifacts —
              to manipulate their fate or curse another’s. But only one could emerge alive.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              And the King would watch. Silent. Smiling. Sipping from his own cup, which never ran dry.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Now, long after his kingdom has faded into myth, the game lives on — passed from ruins to ritual,
              whispered in shadows as a cruel tradition.
            </p>

            <div className="text-center italic text-gray-400 text-lg mt-6">
              “Drink, and be judged.<br />
              Or die, forgotten like the rest.”
